# What is progrmming

It is a collaboration between humans and computer. 
 
## Programming is everywhere.

Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.

## Programming is for everyone

For many years, only a few people have known how to code. However, that’s starting to change. The number of people learning to code is increasing year by year, with estimates around [31.1 million software developers worldwide](https://www.developernation.net/developer-reports/dn22), which doesn’t even account for the many OTHER careers that relate to programming.

Here at Codecademy, our mission is to make technical knowledge accessible and applicable. Technology plays a crucial role in our economy — but programming is no longer just for software engineers. Any person can benefit from learning to program — whether it’s learning HTML to improve your marketing emails or taking a SQL course to add a dose of analysis to your research role.

Even outside of the tech industry, learning to program is essential to participating in the world around you: it affects the products you buy, the legal policies you vote for, and the data you share online.

So, let’s dig into what programming is on the next page, by programming a little virtual robot called codey.
