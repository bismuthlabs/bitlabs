# Programming as communication

“Ok, so now I know what programming is, but what’s coding? I’m here to learn how to code. Are they the same thing?”

While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions.

* *Programming* is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).

* *Coding* is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

Over the past century, humans have been trying to figure out how to best communicate with computers through different programming languages. Programming has evolved from punch cards with rows of numbers that a machine read, to drag-and-drop interfaces that increase programming speed, with lots of other methods in between.
